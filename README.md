# Project Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


The EmployeeSQL_NG folder contains a Table schemata_NG.sql query file, a EmployeeSQL_NG.sql query file, and a QuickDBD exported ERD diagram. The Data folder contains original data in csv forms.
The ERD diagram visualize the relation between the 6 tables.
The Table schemata_NG.sql built the 6 tables into a database schema with:
  All required columns are defined for each table;
  Columns are set to the correct data type;
  Primary Keys set for each table;
  Correctly references related tables;
  Tables are correctly related using Foreign Keys;
  Correctly uses NOT NULL condition on necessary columns;
  Accurately defines value length for columns;
The EmployeeSQL_NG.sql query and analysis data as described in the requirement.
